Hello Everyone ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™ve always been a great problem solver, an independent introvert, and a technophile obsessed with the latest Tech. Today, Iâ€™m working from home as a software engineer and I get to show off all these elements of who I am.

I started learning to code when I was in college, though i have more focus on exploring other domains . After a college education in Computer Science, and continuing to practice programming, I realized software engineering was the right field for me.

Since then, Iâ€™ve worked on countless projects and have been involved with a handful of notable startups. Today, Iâ€™m working as a SDE with the amazing team and am getting into Blockchain on my own time.

Iâ€™m familiar with a variety of programming languages, including NextJs, Solidity, CSS, Python, Java, jQuery, Tailwind CSS but Iâ€™m always adding new skills to my repertoire. Iâ€™m also eager to meet other software engineers in the area, so feel free to connect!
